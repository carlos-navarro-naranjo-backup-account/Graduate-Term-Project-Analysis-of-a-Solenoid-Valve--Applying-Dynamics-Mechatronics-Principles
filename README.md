# Graduate-Term-Project-Analysis-of-a-Solenoid-Valve--Applying-Dynamics-Mechatronics-Principles
Dynamics and Modeling of Mechatronic Systems - Graduate Research Project
 
# Problem Statement & Goal:

The main goal of this report is to analyze a solenoid valve using the principles discussed during 
the Dynamics and Modeling of Mechatronic Systems course. This report presents an overview of 
the common applications of these actuators. It also explains the working principles and slight 
variations currently used by the industry. The report then goes into the full dynamics and 
modeling of the solenoid valve’s electromechanical system. It analyzes the valve’s magnetic 
circuit as well as its interactions with the electromechanical model. The report ends with an 
overall conclusion of the analysis.

# Concepts learned while working in this project:

• Understand dynamics and modeling of lumped-parameter and continuum 
electromechanical systems.

• Analyze and design linear and nonlinear actuators and transducers as crucial elements in 
electromechanical systems.

• Understand and model mechanical-electrical interactions with dynamics and 
electromagnetics principles using lumped elements.

• Determine force using force-energy and force-coenergy relations in lumped 
electromechanical systems. 

• Analyze and model magnetic circuits. This will enable you to design linear and nonlinear 
actuators.

• Analyze and design rotary and linear DC and AC motors. 

• Understand dynamics of mechatronic systems. 

• Understand dynamics of electromechanical continua and derive equations of motion
